Nobody Gives A Damn And Neither Do I,
That's The Way It Goes And That's The Way We Die!

Feel The Sparks In The Night My Baby,
Slip Into The Heat I Will Be There.

I'm Your Candyman, Come On And Take My Hand,
I 'll Lead You Out Of The Dark, Back Into Light Again.

Feel The Need To Cry Out Baby,
Tears Will Fall, But They Don't Really Count.

It's Now Or Never, Round And Round Here We Go,
Come Softly To Me, Stick With Me, Let Me Know.

I've Got A Big, Fat Blast
Beyond Your Imagination.
I've Got A Big, Fat Blast
Life Will Never Be The Same.
I Love The Sweetest Things,
Against Your Regulation.
I've Got A Big, Fat Blast
I'm Enjoying All The Way!
All The Way!

I'm Your Darkest Trance, And It Will Make You Dance,
I Have You In My Grasp, You Want To Make It Last.

Come And Run Away My Baby,
Today Will Be The Day It All Begins.

It's Now Or Never, Round And Round Here We Go,
Come Softly To Me, Stick With Me, Let Me Know.

(Chorus)

(Backwards Satanic Voice)

(Chorus)
