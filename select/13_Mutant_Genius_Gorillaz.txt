Ohh dream on my world
I live on my world
Going out my head, down to somewhere
Goin' on a dance hall tune
In a pressure today
I blew a bad man away today
Had a gun, had to be done i blew a man away
Brother, sister too do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep
Dream on the street
People passing through me, yes, they do
Want mine back i want my heart mend?
I'm gonna bring it all back
Brother, sister too do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep
Brother, sister too do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep
Brother, sister too do what you must do
Now that I, that's right
The river and people seem to die
And keep on to this, keep on
The river ain't deep, the river ain't deep
The river ain't deep
