I bought these skinny black jeans, not to look skinny
just trying not to look like the middle-aged man that I am
My skinny black jeans on this middle-aged man in a battle of time
Makes him look more distorted
And this has been reported
That it makes him look just like a Mutant Ninja Turtle
Walking around Silver Lake
Trying not to be scared
Bout distant affairs
Sure I feel young sure I feel
Sure I feel young sure I feel
Sure I feel right in the right light
I look younger than I am
Not trying to defy time or masquerade as a hipster
I lived through the 90’s but I died in the 60’s
What the fuck does that mean to the young girl eating her lunch alone?
Her lunch
Alone
Staring out of a Whole Foods Window
Lost in a song on her headphones
Looking at that guy crossing Sunset Boulevard
In a green flannel shirt
Sky all purple
Skinny black jeans thinking
Mutant Ninja
Turtle
